# LetterLoopsSolver
LetterLoopsSolver is a Python script that solves letter-based puzzles by detecting letters from images, applying filtering based on known connections, and suggesting the best words. It uses OpenCV, EasyOCR, and an interactive filtering system to refine results dynamically, auto-copying the top candidates for easy input into the puzzle. ðŸš€
